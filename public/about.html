<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kinga Wangmo Dakpa. I just graduated from college and I'm currently taking a small breather. I'm learning web development during my break before I try for a job very soon.
  I'm hoping to finish learning this course successfully.</p>

<p>I find web development to be a very helpful skill. Since this is my first time learning to code ever,
  I find it a bit difficult to grasp some concepts and rules but it is also easy at the same time.</p>

<p>This webpage is a project under this web development course.</p>
